    "1. <b>An objective function</b> that is to be maximized or minimized. \n",
    "     \n",
    "      For example, the **airfare** between Boston and Istanbul.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>A set of constraints</b> (possibly empty) that must be honored. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Many problems of real importance can be **simply formulated** in a way that leads naturally to **a computational solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reducing** a seemingly **new** problem to an instance of **a well-known problem** allows one to use **preexisting** solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Exhaustive enumeration** algorithms provide a simple, but often computationally intractable, way to search for optimal solutions.\n",
